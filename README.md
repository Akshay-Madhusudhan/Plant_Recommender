# Plant_Recommender (Plantwise)
A streamlit app that uses the USDA plants database to recommend plants to users through K-Nearest-Neighbors

Note that data is sourced from the USDA PLANTS website: https://plants.usda.gov

And cleaned data was downloaded from this repo: https://github.com/josephh867/plant-recommender/tree/main/datasets

(Thank you josephh867 data was not downloadable from the site itself)
